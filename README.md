# PyTorch Challenge Scripts and Notebook

Scripts and notebook used for PyTorch Scholarship Challenge

## Files
* [explore_data.py](explore_data.py) - Script for exploration of flower image data
* [train_model.py](train_model.py) - Script for transfer learning of state-of-the-art models from torchvision
* [test_model.py](test_model.py) - Script for evaluating the trained models
* [utils.py](utils.py) - Common functions
* [pytorch-challenge.ipynb](pytorch-challenge.ipynb) - Notebook for training in Google Colab

## Results
* With the use of these scripts and most especially the notebook, along with some optimization techniques, accuracy of 99.0~99.1% was achieved on the validation set.
